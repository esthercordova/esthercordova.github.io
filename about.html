		<h1> About Esther Pia Cordova</h1>
			<div class="about">
			<p> Esther came to America for an exchange semester which was supposed to last 4 months. Instead of four months she stayed. She found real love and got married. Times are harpy (happy and hard). Instead of a happily ever after, which I can tell you doesn't exist, life started. </br></br>

			Since being frustrated by her field, Esther started to have a dream. She wanted to become a web programmer.</br></br>
			Esther wants to contribute to a team, to grow, take responsibilities and to create something of value for people. Participating in the Launch Academy Bootcamp would enable Esther to get a happily ever after. Unfortunatly they can't afford the fees but when she heard about the coding challenge, she realized that this could be her chance. </br></br>

			Here you can see the result of her work. It was a very emotional journey. Between nearly throwing the laptop out of the window several times and dances of joy.
